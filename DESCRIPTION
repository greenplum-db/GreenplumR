Description: Provides an R interface for the Pivotal Data stack
    running on 'PostgreSQL', 'Greenplum' or 'Apache HAWQ (incubating)'
    databases with parallel and distributed computation ability for big data
    processing. 'GreenplumR' provides an R interface to various database
    operations on tables or views. These operations are almost the same as
    the corresponding native R operations. Thus users of R do not need
    to learn 'SQL' when they operate on objects in the database.
